A repository for my Stardew Valley Mod Joja Machines. The mod adds 17 variants to vanilla machines as well as several
events, quests, and special orders. Right now I'm really looking if there is anyone that would like to translate or if
there are any suggestions or bugs. This is my first real mod and I'm sure it can be improved in a lot of ways.
